My Go Things
============

In this project I focus on trying to express some properties of a given position that are typically used by a go player to evaluate score, strength of groups etc.
The actual aim is to estimate score and compute possible moves with their reasons, as well as determining if a group is alive or dead (or if its life depends on the death of another group for instance), _without using monte-carlo evaluation or any other statistical stuff.
